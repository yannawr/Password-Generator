# Password-Generator
Part of my python studies

## **Key features**:

* **Customized Length**: Choose the password length between 8 and 20 characters. You decide the password's length, enabling adaptation to different security requirements.

* **Character Selection**: Personalize your password by selecting uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or both. This option enhances the diversity and complexity of the password.

* **Inclusion of Numbers**: Opt to include numbers in your password to make it even more robust against attacks.

* **Special Characters**: Increase the strength of your password by selecting the option to include special characters. This adds symbols such as !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), _, +, -, =, [, ], {, }, ;, :, ,, ., <, >, and /.

* **Character Ambiguity**: Decide whether to include or avoid ambiguous characters in your password, such as 'l' and 'I', 'O' and '0', which can cause visual confusion.
