# Password-Generator
The "Password Generator" is a flexible tool built in Python, allowing users to easily and securely create customized passwords. With this generator, users have complete control over the composition of their passwords, being able to choose from various options to meet their security needs.

## **Key features**:

* **Customized Length**: Choose the password length between 8 and 20 characters. You decide the password's length, enabling adaptation to different security requirements.

* **Character Selection**: Personalize your password by selecting uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or both. This option enhances the diversity and complexity of the password.

* **Inclusion of Numbers**: Opt to include numbers in your password to make it even more robust against attacks.

* **Special Characters**: Increase the strength of your password by selecting the option to include special characters. This adds symbols such as !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), _, +, -, =, [, ], {, }, ;, :, ,, ., <, >, and /.

* **Character Ambiguity**: Decide whether to include or avoid ambiguous characters in your password, such as 'l' and 'I', 'O' and '0', which can cause visual confusion.
